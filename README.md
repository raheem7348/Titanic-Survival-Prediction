# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

**📌 Project Overview**

Titanic Survival Prediction is a machine learning–based classification project that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on key personal and travel-related features such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and family details.

This project uses Logistic Regression, a simple yet powerful classification algorithm, to demonstrate the complete machine learning workflow — from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model training and performance evaluation.

The project is beginner-friendly and focuses on building an interpretable model while understanding real-world data challenges.

**🚀 Features**

✅ Predicts passenger survival (Binary Classification: Survived / Not Survived)

✅ Uses Logistic Regression for clarity and interpretability

✅ Handles real-world dataset with missing values and categorical features

✅ Performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

✅ Visualizes survival trends based on gender, class, and age

✅ Applies data preprocessing (encoding, scaling, null handling)

✅ Evaluates model using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report

✅ Clean, lightweight, and easy to understand — ideal for ML beginners
